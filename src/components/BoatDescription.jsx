        It is the boat that marks a before and after in Day Boats, with a
        magnificent V-shaped hull by Michael Peters, one of the best naval
        architects, complemented by the decidedly sporty design of Camillo
        Garroni, creative and innovative.
      </p>
      <p>
        The open design of the upper deck provides a feeling of total openness
        and connection with the surroundings and as if you were on a large
        terrace overlooking the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DB/43 offers exceptional interior space, with two premium cabins
        that can accommodate up to 5 berths. In addition, up to two bathrooms
        are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The noble materials, the indirect lighting and the level of the finishes
        (floating oak wood, leather, exquisite upholstery, impeccable carpentry)
        make you feel in the most privileged place of the sea, which you can see
        through its luminous windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DB/43 incorporates the Seanapps system. All remote monitoring,
        control and maintenance functions of the vessel can be controlled from
        your smartphone.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can turn the deck into a large, pleasant and comfortable chillout
        and play your favorite music playlists thanks to the integrated audio
        system.
      </p>
        <p>Outboard or Inboard? Both options are available.</p>
